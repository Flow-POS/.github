## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Create a new module in the `packages/` directory using the Flutter package template:
   ```bash
   flutter create --template=package packages/new_module
   ```
2. Update the `pubspec.yaml` to include the new module:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     new_module:
       path: packages/new_module
   ```
3. Develop and test the module independently before integrating it into the main app.

### Independent Module Development
Each module is a Dart package with its own repository, allowing teams to:
- Work independently without conflicts.
- Version and test modules separately.

### State Management with Riverpod
- Use `StateNotifier` and `Provider` for efficient and reactive state management.
